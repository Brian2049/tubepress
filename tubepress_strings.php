THANKS:
This plugin was based on the "mytube" plugin by Vaam Yob (http://rane.hasitsown.com/blog/plink/technical/27/wordpress-youtube-video-gallery-plugin/) and
some code samples from WaxJelly (http://www.waxjelly.com/2006/08/29/a-more-complex-php-script-using-the-youtube-api-with-video-details-part-2/). Thanks!
